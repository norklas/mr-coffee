## My Portfolio Website

This is my portfolio site, which is an ongoing work in progress! I plan to add more as I do more projects. I'd also like to redesign the layout. My big motivation for doing this was to learn responsive web design. I learned some valuable skills with responsive web design, and I hope to keep improving!

## Installation

No installation required, static site. Please visit, [Mr. Coffee, my portfolio](https://norklas.github.io/mr-coffee/) to take a look!

## Usage

Static site, so no real usage instructions. However, my goal was to make it responsive, so make sure to use the dev tools to check it out!
